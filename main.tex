\section{Question: How does your assembly code compare to what the compiler generated from goto? }
It is faster than the goto and uses less memory. The first three registers are used to set memory.
\section{Question:What happens if you include "ret;" instead of "jmp end;" in your assembly code when you try to run the program? }
It would cause the program to crash. I was unable to get myprogram to compile so was unable to see the compiler.
